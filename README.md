# duckdb-polars-rust

This repo shows an end-to-end example of how to go from a DuckDB query
to a Polars dataframe in Rust using DuckDB's Arrow query interface.

It's best paired with this blog post: [not published yet].

Did you find an error? Is it not up-to-date? Feel free to open a PR.

A good next step from this code is to create an easier-to-use iterator
over these query results. I leave that as an exercise for the reader
(and future me).
